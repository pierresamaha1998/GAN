GAN - Personal Learning

GANs are an interesting topic I have always wanted to play with. There are already many types of GANs, in general, a GAN consists of a discriminator and a generator, in which the generator makes new (fake) samples, and feed them to the discriminator, that has to detect whether if the sample is fake, or if it comes from the training dataset.
